# BlackJack-Adviser
BlackJack Card Counting Advisor Algorithm
This program shall serve the purpose of enabling the player in Blackjack to make strategic decisions within the game. The program will advise whether the player should "Hit," "Stand," "Split," or "Double Down" based on advanced probabilities and common Blackjack strategies. The program continuously runs the player through multiple hands until they choose to quit.
It first asks the user to input how many decks they want to deal with; then it prepares the deck accordingly. In the process of going on with the game, the player inputs the values of his cards and the visible card of the dealer. Then, the program uses the input in determining chances concerning winning based on all right occasions for the player as well as the dealer. It then provides suggestions on whether to hit, stand, split, or double down.
It deals with special conditions, such as splitting pairs and doubling down. If the players' initial two-card strength is the same, then they can split into two different hands. If the total of the hands comes to 9, 10, or 11, then this program may advise them to double down, making it possible for the user to double the bet and get one more card.
The software then jumbles up the deck, randomlyizes it, and often shuffles it a few more times when the game is in progress. After every move the program makes—or after cards are displayed and shown—the probabilities are updated for the cards it must be holding. The game continues in this way, new cards brought up for input by the player until, of course, the word "exit" is typed, which stops the session.
This program is not only a strategic tool but also a learning aid, helping players to better understand when and why to take certain actions in Blackjack. Players can practice with the program in order to better their decision-making and improve their overall gameplay in this regard.
